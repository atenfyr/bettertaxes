Overhauls the Tax Collector to be more useful with a few changes:
    * Increases the Tax Collector's money cap to 50 platinum rather than 10 gold.
    * Increases profit depending on how far in the game you are, including support for both Calamity and Thorium.
    * Adds the ability for the Tax Collector to automatically place his earnings into a Piggy Bank, Safe, or Defender's Forge placed in his room at midnight every day.
    * Adds a config file to modify the above values as well as the paycheck rate and money cap.
    * Adds a system in the config to add custom rent values for mods, given some programming knowledge.
    * Adds a few extra things the Tax Collector can say.

This mod was ported to Terraria 1.4 by @NoLongerLucky - thank you!
