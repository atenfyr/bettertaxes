# BetterTaxes
Better Taxes overhauls the Tax Collector to be more useful with some small changes:
* Increases the Tax Collector's money cap to 50 platinum rather than 25 gold.
* Increases profit depending on how far in the game you are:
    * At the start, rent is 50 copper a minute per NPC, or 6.3 gold an hour with 21 NPCs. (This is the vanilla amount regardless of progression.)
    * After defeating any mechanical boss, rent raises to 1 silver a minute per NPC, or 12.6 gold an hour with 21 NPCs.
    * After defeating Plantera, rent raises to 2 silver a minute per NPC, or 25.2 gold an hour with 21 NPCs.
    * After defeating Golem, rent raises to 5 silver a minute per NPC, or 63 gold an hour with 21 NPCs.
    * After defeating the Moon Lord, rent raises to 10 silver a minute per NPC, or 1.26 platinum an hour with 21 NPCs.
    * There are four extra tiers with Calamity installed:
        * After defeating Providence, rent raises to 12.5 silver a minute per NPC, or 1.65 platinum an hour with 22 NPCs.
        * After defeating the Devourer of Gods, rent raises to 15 silver a minute per NPC, or 1.98 platinum an hour with 22 NPCs.
        * After defeating Yharon, rent raises to 25 silver a minute per NPC, or 3.3 platinum an hour with 22 NPCs.
        * After defeating Supreme Calamitas, rent raises to 50 silver a minute per NPC, or 6.6 platinum an hour with 22 NPCs.
    * If Thorium is installed and the Ragnar√∂k has been defeated, rent raises to 15 silver a minute per NPC, or 1.98 platinum an hour with 22 NPCs. If downed bosses in Calamity would increase rent to higher than this, they do so.
    * If expert mode is enabled, the Tax Collector will give 1.5x the amount of money specified above.
    * If master mode is enabled, the Tax Collector will give 2.0x the amount of money specified above.
    * The effects of happiness on the Tax Collector's rent and money cap are disabled, but can be re-enabled in the config.
* Adds the ability for the Tax Collector to automatically place his earnings into a Piggy Bank, Safe, or Defender's Forge placed in his room at midnight every day.
* Adds a config file to modify the above values as well as the paycheck rate and money cap.
* Adds a system in the config to add custom rent values for mods. See [the wiki](https://github.com/nolongerlucky/bettertaxes/wiki) for more information.
* Adds a few extra things the Tax Collector can say.
